Dear reader, thank you for picking this thesis to read. Reading a thesis is often an
annoying \emph{task}, and it is also a very difficult task to do as well. Despite what my
advisors tell me, I like to write in a style slightly different from the style seen often
in science publications. I ask you, dear reader, to tolerate my style of writing, I try to
write the text as if I were explaining all the stuff to my past-self (especifically, to my
own one-and-a-half-years past self). You will find many overexplanatory sentences,
paragraphs and complete subchapters, with examples and other uncommon customs. My
intention is, after all, to be a guide for my past-self to come where I have arrived, but
faster.
